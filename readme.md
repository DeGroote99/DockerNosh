# Docker-NOSH


## Installation
### Step 1: Preparation
1. It is recommended to use an email service to take advantage of all the features of NOSH such as message and schedule notifications.  [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) is a compatible mail service.
2. Make sure you have a domain name registered and linked to the WAN IP (Wide Area Network Internet Protocol) address where Docker-NOSH is connected to.  You can get  one at [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com).  They have great instructions for how to do this.
3. If your Docker-NOSH is installed physically and is behind a network router, make sure port forwarding is set on your router for ports 22 (for SSH), 80 (for HTTP), and 443 (for HTTPS) routed to the LAN IP (Local Area Network Internet Protocol) address for Docker-NOSH.

### Step 2: Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
1. If you use Linux, install Docker based on the distribution you use such as [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/), [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/), [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/), and [Arch/Manjaro](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Docker).
2. If you use Linux, install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#linux)

### Step 3: Download and install Git
[Git for Windows.](https://gitforwindows.org/)

[Git for Mac.](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

[Git for Linux.](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

### Step 4: Install Docker-NOSH
#### Windows:
1. If using [Docker Toolbox for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/), make sure Docker is active.
2. Win + R to open the Run window; type in <code>powershell</code> and press Enter.
3. In Powershell: <code>$Env:COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1</code>
4. Click the Windows or Start icon.  In the Programs list, open the Git folder.  Click the option for Git Bash.
5. <code>git clone https://github.com/shihjay2/docker-nosh.git</code>
6. <code>cd docker-nosh</code>
7. <code>./init_win.sh</code>

#### Mac:
1. If using [Docker Toolbox for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/), make sure Docker is active.
2. Open the Applications folder. Open Utilities and double-click on Terminal.
3. <code>git clone https://github.com/shihjay2/docker-nosh.git</code>
4. <code>cd docker-nosh</code>
5. <code>./init.sh</code>

#### Linux:
1. Open a command-line terminal.
2. <code>git clone https://github.com/shihjay2/docker-nosh.git</code>
3. <code>cd docker-nosh</code>
4. <code>./init.sh</code>

### Stopping NOSH
1. Go to the docker-nosh directory.
2. <code>docker-compose down<code>
3. This will shut down the Docker container without removing the volumes (data) that has been saved from your NOSH instance.

### Removing NOSH
1. Go to the docker-nosh directory.
2. <code>docker-compose down -v<code>
3. This will shut down the Docker container in addition to removing the volumes (data).  Please ensure you have a backup or that there is no valuable data to save before doing this; once it's done you can't retrieve your data!
